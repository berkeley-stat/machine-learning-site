## Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes in Clustering

![](images/jordan_project_picture.gif)

A Dirichlet process (DP) is a distribution on distributions that is
useful in model-based clustering problems. In particular, a draw from a
DP yields a random set of atoms that can be treated as the parameters of
the components in a mixture model. Each such draw contains an infinite
collection of atoms, making this methodology a nonparametric approach to
model-based clustering. To treat problems in which we have not only a
single group of data to be clustered, but multiple, interrelated groups
of data, we have extended the DP to the hierarchical Dirichlet process
(HDP). In the HDP the base measure for each of a set of child DPs is
itself distributed according to a DP. Such a base measure being
discrete, the child DPs necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the
mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture
components. The HDP has found applications to a variety of real-world
problems in areas such as genetics, information retrieval, computational
vision and time series analysis.

## Detection of Clouds over Ice

Clouds play a major role in Earth\'s climate and cloud detection is a
crucial step in the processing of satellite observations. To advance the
observational capabilities of detecting clouds, NASA launched the
Multi-angle Imagin and SpectroRadiometer (MISR) in 1999. It provides
data in nine different views using four spectral channels.

In this project, the goal is to determine which regions observed by the
MISR satellite are covered by clouds at polar regions. There, the
classification is made difficult by the ice cover on the background of
the images. The amount of cloud cover is an important parameter in
meteorological models and massive amounts of data are transmitted by
MISR. This requires the classification method to be both accurate and
computationally efficient.
